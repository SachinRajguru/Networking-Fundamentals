# Networking Fundamentals

## Introduction

Networking Fundamentals is the foundation of how the internet works. Just like understanding how letters are delivered through a postal system helps you grasp the concept of mailing, understanding networking helps you comprehend how data travels across the internet.

In simple terms, when you open a website, send an email, or stream a video, data travels through a complex network of devices and protocols. This guide breaks down those concepts into easy-to-understand pieces.

Whether you are building applications, managing cloud infrastructure, or simply curious about how the internet works, this guide will provide you with the essential knowledge needed to understand and work with networked systems confidently.
